##Hi, I am Aitor Zaldua. 
###I have really enjoyed my career up to this point, always with a customer first mentality and building solid and, above all, safe projects. My experience covers two main blocks:
12 years of experience as a business continuity and disaster recovery engineer, auditing every day the security of their IT services and conducting annually their resilience tests.
8 years of experience in software development and management for IT companies.
