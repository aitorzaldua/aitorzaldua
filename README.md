## Hi, I am Aitor Zaldua, Smart Contract and Blockchain Developer.

#### I have really enjoyed my career up to this point, always with a customer first mentality and building solid and, above all, safe projects. My experience covers two main blocks:

▻ 12 years of experience as a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery engineer and Account Manager, auditing every day the security of their IT services and performing annual resilience audits for each client.

▻ 8 years of experience in Software Development and Management for IT companies.

During these stages I have had clients such as JPMorgan, Credit Agricole, BBVA, Altura Markets, Inversis, Telefonica/Movistar, Vodafone, Adecco among others.

#### Passionate about forward-looking challenges, I am currently working as a web3 developer, a new technology that fits perfectly with my usual priorities: Security, Resilience and Customer Oriented.
