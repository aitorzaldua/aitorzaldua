## Hi, I am Aitor Zaldua, smart contract and blockchain developer.

#### I have really enjoyed my career up to this point, always with a customer first mentality and building solid and, above all, safe projects. My experience covers two main blocks:

▻ 12 years of experience as a business continuity and disaster recovery engineer, auditing every day the security of their IT services and performing annual resilience audits for each client.

▻ 8 years of experience in software development and management for IT companies.

#### Passionate about forward-looking challenges, I am currently working as a web3 developer, a new technology that fits perfectly with my usual priorities: Security, Resilience and customer oriented.

## Some technologies I use:
